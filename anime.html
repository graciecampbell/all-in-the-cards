            <h1>About</h1>
            <p><i>Horimiya</i> is the anime adaption of HERO and Daisuke Hagiwara's Horimiya manga series and the original Hori-san to Miyamura-kun webcomic by HERO.</p>
            <p> Kyoko Hori's parents are often away from home due to work, leaving her to look after her younger brother and do the housework, leaving no opportunities to make friends and socialize outside of school. Meanwhile, Izumi Miyamura is a gentle person hopeless at studying. By sheer happenstance, Hori and Miyamura cross paths outside of schoolâ€”neither looking as the other expects. These seemingly polar opposites become fast friends, sharing with each other a side of themselves they have never shown to anyone else.</p>
